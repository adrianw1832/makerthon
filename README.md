##Makerthon

This project is from the week 9 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy course.
Makerthon is basically a three day hackerthon where we can choose a project of
our choice and work together in a group in preparation for the final project. We
basically had from Monday lunch till Wednesday afternoon at which point we had
to present what we did. We decided to try and make a clone of the web game
Agar.io. The scope of the project was really quite something but to our
surprise, we had a functional multiplayer game at the end, despite it being
laggy and kind of buggy. This is the first time we fully utilised git flow,
waffle.io and agile methods.

##Challenges

As mentioned before, the scope of the project was rather large for what is
essentially two days. We were definitely not very positive as to how much we
could implement, but all of us wanted a challenge and that's why we chose this.
We did not do TDD because this was a hackerthon and mainly, because all the
technologies we used were new so that we were not sure on how to test. The code
ended being a mess too since all we cared about near the end was to try and
frantically make it work. Considering the fact that canvas, a lot of the jQuery
movements, Node, Sockets and Express were completely new to us, we were happy
with the fact that we had something to show for at the end of two days of work.

##Technologies used

Javascript, jQuery, HTML5 Canvas, Node, Sockets, Express

##How to install

Clone the repo and run node server in the terminal, then visit localhost:3000 to
play. The deployed heroku version is very laggy but we did deploy.
